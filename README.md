The Project Step 1 consisted of project's description
Step 2 was to write the "CREATE TABLE" statements with proper relations and a creating a Relational Model of our database.
Step 3 was creating 3 webpages to edit our database. The first site is used to enter data to db. Second site is to delete a row from a table and all the related tables. And the third page lists the people in our database with the given name.
Step 4 I created an admin page in which I could edit the important tables, insert and remove from them. I also added a LinkedIn styled feed page that showed recent posts and comments of users and/or companies, and the connections between users.
And lastly in step 5, I added a support page for users and added that page to the admin panel. This page is used to communicate between the clients and admin.
